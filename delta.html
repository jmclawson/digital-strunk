<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>A rational way of writing to a specific audience calls for literal understanding of what the writer is trying to say. When talking to high schoolers, make sure they understand what is being expressed to the audience and that will draw them in. With a professional audience, like professors and authority figures, the writer must present a professional approach to the writings. The writer wants the viewers to understand what they are saying and to approach it with a literal point of view. For example when writing to other people the writing should make sense to the person reading the information because we do not want the reader to feel like they wasted their time reading the article provided to them. Also it will help the writer have a better understanding of what they wrote seeing that writing is very important; it is an extended invitation to the writer’s ways of thinking. </p>

<p>In English classes we are taught many of different styles of writing; we are taught different ways of understanding what the audience is reading. We are also taught that when writing an essay, there are different ways to pull the audience in and keep their attention by following writing rules we have been provided with to make our writing make sense. Nobody wants to look bad when being evaluated on a literal stage, so in order for us to be able to stand up, or out, we need to follow certain rules and regulations. </p>

<p>Little things like capitalization and punctuation play a big role in being understood through writing. When writing there are certain ways to catch the audience’s attention or the reader’s attention, and that can be by having similar problems or writing about things that people can relate to. The reader also needs to understand what is being said so it is important to use the proper use of commas, semicolons, and periods. So remember when writing to a specific person or group remember the grammar rules that must be followed and try not to confuse the audience. As long as we follow these rules and guidelines the reader and writer will not have any trouble understanding one another.</p>
