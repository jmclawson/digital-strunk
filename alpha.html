<h1>Alpha Squadron</h1>

<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>Writing rules are set for a global society and are the base for communication. These rules come from Strunk's <i>Elements of Style</i>, which consists of eighteen total rules.</p>

<p>These kinds of rules allow people from different cultures to have one way of using the language for better understanding.  Many do not enjoy the hassle of guidelines because they are difficult to follow sometimes. Despite many people's rejection of the formal rules, writing in certain guidelines is essential in effectively getting a point across. For an example rule six states "do not break sentences into two."  The incorrect way to use this rule would be, "yesterday I went to Six flags. And won a bear for my friend."  The correct way to write this would be, "yesterday I went to Six Flags and won a bear for my friend."  Guidelines help sentences sound fuller, richer and in place.</p>

<p>Without guidelines, it can be fairly easy to become confused or misled by what someone wrote or is trying to explain in their document like the example in the previous paragraph.  If everyone decided not to use punctuation or did not take the time to enforce the rules, we would all be confused and unknowing of what is going on. </p>
