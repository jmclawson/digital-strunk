<h1>Troop Bravo</h1>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>It is important to follow certain writing guidelines because if not, then it will be hard for an audience to understand. Rules are placed so that things will flow smoothly. For instance, if the writer is writing to a particular audience but does not have a topic sentence or even a thesis to support the argument, he or she should ask a few questions just in case the brainstorming does not work out: "what am I trying to tell the reader? what words can I express to them to let them know where I am coming from? what image or idiom will make it clearer from my point of view? is the image fresh enough to have an effect on what I am saying, from the main idea of the topic?"</p>

<p>Writing rules may seem unnecessary to some, but they are there to bring clarity to the writing, so that it is clearly understood by the audience. Identify the basic topic, analyze the material that the writing is on, address the different perspectives, examine the contexts, identify the idea of the topic when starting the writing, and just make sure to stay focused on the key points. It  may seem silly to some but it is extremely necessary. For example one writing rule is to always put a period at the end of a sentence. If not, a lot of run-ons will confuse the writer's view . Rules really just bring clarity to the audience so that they understand of what is being said from the guidelines of writing.</p>
